# 🎯 Current Project Status & Next Steps

## ✅ What's Working
1. **Backend Server**: Running on port 3001 with MongoDB Atlas
2. **ngrok Tunnel**: Active at `https://reversibly-overtalkative-ghislaine.ngrok-free.dev`

## 🔧 Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Manual Metro Start
```bash
# Kill any existing processes

```

### Option 2: Use Development Build
```bash
# If you have Expo Dev Client installed
npx expo start --dev-client
```

### Option 3: Web Development
```bash
# Start for web development
npx expo start --web
```

### Option 4: Direct Metro
```bash
# Start Metro directly
npx react-native start
```
