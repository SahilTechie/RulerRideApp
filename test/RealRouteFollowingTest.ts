      steps: [
        "1. Enter destination 'Gitam University' from Khapatnam",
        "2. System geocodes destination coordinates",
        "3. Google Directions API fetches real driving route",
        "4. Map displays curved polyline following actual roads",
        "5. Distance overlay shows API distance (e.g., 12.5 km) vs straight line (8.2 km)",
        "6. Duration shows real driving time (e.g., 18 min)"

      steps: [
        "1. When Google Directions API is unavailable",
        "2. System automatically falls back to curved path calculation",
        "3. Shows estimated distance and duration",
        "4. Route still displays (curved, not straight line)",
        "5. User experience remains smooth"

      scenario: "Real-time Route Updates",
      steps: [
        "1. User types 'Visakhapatnam Airport'",
        "2. Loading indicator shows during geocoding + route calculation",
        "3. Route polyline updates to follow highways and main roads",
        "4. Distance/duration updates to show longer but faster route",
        "5. Map region adjusts to show complete route path"
