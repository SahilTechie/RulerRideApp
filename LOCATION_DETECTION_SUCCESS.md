### 🚀 **Automatic Pickup Location Detection**
Your RulerRide dashboard now includes intelligent location detection that:

- Map converts clicked coordinates to address automatically
- Pickup field updates instantly with the new address
- Green marker shows your selected location

#### **Address Conversion Examples:**
```
Coordinates: [17.6868, 83.2185]
↓ (Free Nominatim API)
Address: "Jagadamba Junction, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh"

Coordinates: [17.7000, 83.2300]
